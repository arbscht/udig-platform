Introduction

Welcome to the User-friendly Internet Desktop GIS (uDig) application!

uDig is collaborative effort brought together by a diverse project management committee from organizations across the world:

 * Andrea Antonello (Italy)

 * Frank Gasdorf (Germany)

 * Jesse Eichar (Switzerland)

 * Jody Garnett (Australia)

 * Mauricio Pazos (Spain)

uDig was originated at `Refractions Research <http://www.refractions.net/>`_ in Canada with funding from `GeoConnections <http://www.geoconnections.org/>`_ Canada.

uDig is intended to be used in conjunction with your existing investment in spatial information.
We are of the opinion that your data is what is important. To that end we support a wide range of
formats, compatibility with a range of spatial databases and accessing of information services
such as WMS and WFS.

We also recognize the expectations placed on a desktop application with support for printing
and excellent desktop integration. 

The use of an open source license (`EPL <http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html>`_ and
`BSD <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_) allows the uDig project to be used
by your organization with no per seat license.

In addition to supporting an open source license, uDig is also offers an open vendor-neutral
development model with clear procedures allowing your team to take part.
